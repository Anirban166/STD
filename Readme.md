Contains a simple example of using STest as a standalone library. Run `make && ./test.bin` to test the [basic example](https://github.com/Anirban166/STD/blob/main/test.cpp).

Note: STest is a rule-based testing framework originally developed in JPL. An open-sourced version of it (written in C++) exists in [fprime](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/tree/master/STest), which is the one I'm using here.
